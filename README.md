# tabata

Tabata is a learning project in clojure where I make a single page application for doing hiit exercises.

This project was inspired by the awesome content on the /r/hiit subreddit. I enjoyed the workouts people created and shared, but wanted a more minimalistic tool for doing them.

## features

- edit the exercise, choose from one of many exercises
- play it from start to finish
- pause
- skip forward/backwards in the exercise

## Roadmap

- continuous mode, do many repetitions of the exercise
- discover an exercise
- share an exercise
  - Using a url, anyone can view the exercise?

### maybe

- log in
- save my exercises. Publish them with others
- record my exercises. So that I have a log of how much hiit I've been doing.
